# Game of Life

A Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton simulation that demonstrates how complex patterns can emerge from simple rules.

## Project Overview

This implementation features:
- Python-based console visualization
- Classic Game of Life rules:
  - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation)
  - Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation
  - Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation)
  - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction)

## Technical Details

The project is implemented in Python, using basic console output for visualization. It demonstrates fundamental programming concepts including:
- 2D array manipulation
- Cellular automata rules
- Console-based visualization
- Game loop implementation

## Project Context

This project was created as a test implementation to evaluate the effectiveness of Roo Code connected to Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet 20241022-v2:0. It serves as a demonstration of:
- AI-assisted code development
- Version control workflow
- Project documentation practices
- Code organization and structure

## Getting Started

To run the simulation:
```bash
python game_of_life.py
```

## Development Notes

This project was developed with assistance from Roo Code, an AI-powered development tool, using Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet model. The implementation process showcased the capabilities of AI-assisted development in:
- Project setup and organization
- Code implementation
- Documentation generation
- Version control integration
